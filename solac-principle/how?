# Lossless Audio Codec with AI Optimization

This project is an open-source **lossless audio codec** designed for high-efficiency compression and high-quality audio restoration. The codec utilizes **artificial intelligence (AI)** techniques to optimize repetitive processing tasks, enabling better compression ratios while maintaining perfect audio quality.

## Features
- Lossless Compression: Achieves perfect restoration of original audio without any data loss.
- AI-Powered Compression: Uses deep learning models to analyze and optimize audio patterns for efficient compression.
- Automatic Pattern Recognition: The AI learns repetitive patterns in audio data, improving compression without compromising quality.
- Optimized Performance: Designed for use on various platforms, with high performance even on lower-spec devices.

## How It Works
1. Encoding: AI models analyze the audio signal to extract repeating patterns and compress the data effectively.
2. Decoding: The compressed data is restored using advanced AI models, ensuring the output is identical to the original audio.
3. AI Models: Leveraging Autoencoders, Generative Models, and other AI techniques, the codec learns to optimize both compression and decompression processes.
